iXperience Year 2 Session 3 Exercises Repository
================================================

Welcome to iXperience! We're so excited to have you here :). If you have any issues, please feel free reach out to your TAs, Erica and Ian. This is the repository where you'll put your homework.

How to Use This Repo
-----------------------

Follow these directions closely to set up your repository.

1. Fork this repository. You can do this by clicking the ```Fork``` button on the top right of this page, and following those instructions. Navigate to the github page of the new repo you just forked. Then, navigate to the github page of the repo you just forked (note: the repo name in the top left should look something like ```bbugh/s0203_exercises``` forked from ```iExperience/s0203_exercises```).
2. Clone your fork to your ```ixperience``` folder. You can do this by going to your terminal/command line tool, changing into your ```ixperience``` directory by typing in ```cd ixperience```, and then typing ```git clone REPO_URL```. You can find the correct ```REPO_URL``` on your github page. We recommend using the SSH clone URL.
3. ```cd``` into the ```s0203_exercises``` folder.
4. Create a directory under the ```s0203_exercises``` folder using your real name and github account name, like ```s0203_exercises/BrianBugh-bbugh```. That will make it easier for us to remember who everyone's github name is!
5. ```cd``` into your new directory.
6. Save any homework files or files you change to this folder. IMPORTANT: Only save files into your personal folder (the directory named after your name and github username).
